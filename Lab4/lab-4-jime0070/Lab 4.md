# Lab 4

### Objectives

- Create functions in Python
- Call functions in Python
- Use some of the circuit playground APIs



### Part 1

Download the file lab4.py.

In Pycharm or vs code, add a function `CelToFahr` that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Test your function.

In Pycharm or vs code, create a function `min`. This function receives two arguments and returns the smallest of the two inputs. Test your function.

In Pycharm or vs code, create a function `VolumeOfSphere`. This function receives one argument, the radius of the sphere and returns the volume of the sphere. Test your function.

Test your code, save the file as `lab4-1.py` then upload it to GitHub.

### Part 2

Download the file `circuitplayground_slide_switch.py`

Save the file on the circuit playground as `code.py` and run the code to see what is printed depending on the position of the slider.

### Part 3

Download the file `circuitplayground_temperature.py`

Save the file on the circuit playground as `code.py` and run it.

### Part 4

Based on the knowledge you gained in Part 2 and Part 3, write a program that:

- gets the temperature from the sensor.
- converts the temperature to Fahrenheit by calling the function CelToFahr if the slider value is `True` .
- converts the temperature to Celsius by calling the function FahrToCell if the slider value is `False` .
- prints the result in the console.

Test your code, save the file as `lab4-4.py` then upload it to GitHub.

### Part 5

Download the file `circuitplayground_button_a.py`

Run the file on the playground to learn how to process a button click.

Modify your program from Part 4 to display the result in the console only when the user presses button a.

Test your code, save the file as `lab4-5.py` then upload it to GitHub.

### Submission

Upload your 3 python programs to github
